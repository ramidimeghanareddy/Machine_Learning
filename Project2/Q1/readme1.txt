Q1

a) Implemented a linear regression learner to solve this best fit problem for 1 dimensional data for different ”function depths” (at least to ”depth” 6).

b) Applied regression learner to the data set that was generated for Question 1b) and created a plot for the resulting function together with the data points

c) Evaluated the regression functions by computing the error on the test data points that were generated for Question 1c). Function Depth 4 would be consider the best prediction because the regression line which touches of comes on the feature attribute values which make the prediction more reliable on that. Hence we got the minimum mean square error on this depth 4 function too. So we consider the depth 4 function the best fit.
K values = 2,3 will get minimum error

d) Repeated the experiment and evaluation of part b) and c) using only the first 20 elements of the training data set part b) and the Test set of part c). 
As you are aware, we used a 20-row dataset from an attribute where you are aware that when the dataset's sample size is too little, we are unable to obtain reliable results. Let's take an example where everything is written in a huge dataset, such as house prices with area, and we can compute the prices using a large dataset using various different data points of the area to obtain the number of that price, allowing us to estimate the prices of areas with ease.
