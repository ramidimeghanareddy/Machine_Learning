Q3

a) Implemented logistic regression to classify the data based on height, weight, and age.

b) Created 3 2-D plots for the resulting separating boundary surface along with the data points.

c) Evaluated the performance of the logistic regression classifier using leave-one-out validation and compared the results with those for KNN and Na√Øve Bayes.
The validation accuracy with all 3 predictors is 70.83%, whereas for KNN and Naive Bayes it was 63.33% and 70% respectively. This means our model is far better than the KNN model, and slightly better than the Naive Bayes model.

d) Evaluated the performance of the logistic regression classifier with the age feature removed using leave-one-out validation.
The validation accuracy only 2 predictors is 69.17%, whereas for both KNN and Naive Bayes it was 70.83%. This means our model underperforming as compared to KNN and Naive Bayes, since the latter 2 perform well in smaller dimensions.
