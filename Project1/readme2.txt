Question: 2 - Gaussian Naive Bayes

a) Created the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm by the following steps:
	Step 1: Separate the training dataset by class
	Step 2: Summarize the dataset (Calculate Mean, Standard Deviation, and count from the given dataset)
	Step 3: Summarize data by class using the above function
	Step 4: Calculate Gaussian Probability Density Function
	Step 5: Calculate the class probabilities
	Step 6: Make the prediction from the class probabilities by choosing the class with the highest probability

b) Using the algorithm, make the predictions of the test data.

c) Evaluate the performance of the algorithm, using the Leave One Out Evaluation.

d) Evaluate the performance of the algorithm after removing the 'age' data.

e) Compared the performance of the two algorithms (KNN and Gaussian). We can therefore draw the conclusion that the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm performs better thanÂ KNN.
